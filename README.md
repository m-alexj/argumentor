Research-grade code for the thesis "Global Inference and Local Syntax Representations for Event Extraction"

This repository contains code for Chapter 4, where I tried to evaluate how promising it is to encode syntax paths connecting event triggers and potential event arguments.

Please not that this code is (a) very old, (b) not maintained in any form. However, it specifies how the experiments were carried out. Please also note that I cannot add the training, development or test data used because it is directly derived from ACE 2005.
